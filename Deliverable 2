Target User Group
 College Commuters
 Undergraduate students who live off-campus and rely on driving or campus buses to attend classes, often facing inconsistent parking availability and limited transportation options.

Problem Description
 Commuter students frequently waste time searching for parking or waiting on shuttles, which can make them late for classes and reduce overall academic performance. The lack of real time updates on parking availability and shuttle timing creates unnecessary stress, lowers class attendance, and affects students who cannot afford on-campus housing.

Evidence of the Problem
Commuter Student Population: Approximately 85% of undergraduate students in the U.S. commute to campus, either from home or nearby housing .


Transportation Challenges: A study by Trellis Company found that 26% of students reported missing class "rarely" or "sometimes" due to a lack of reliable transportation .Trellis Company


Parking Issues: A survey at UCLA revealed that 69% of students felt not obtaining a parking permit negatively affected their academic experiences, highlighting the impact of parking availability on student success .Daily Bruin



“How Might We” Statement
 How might we improve access to reliable transportation and parking information for commuter students so they can reduce stress, save time, and improve class attendance?
