User Group Profile - College Commuters:
Who: Undergraduate students who live off-campus and commute (by car or campus bus) to attend classes.
Demographics (typical / target):
Age: 18–24 (undergraduate).


Income: large spread — many working part-time; some financial constraints.


Tech comfort: High — near-universal smartphone ownership in this age group. Pew Research Center


Common habits & context
Drive or ride campus shuttles daily; check phone for directions; use maps and scheduling apps; balance work + classes.


Peak demand: mornings (class start window), evenings, and between major class blocks.


Primary pain points
Time wasted cruising for parking or standing at unpredictable shuttle stops.


Late arrivals (penalties, missed material).


Stress and extra cost (parking fees, parking permit uncertainty).


Lack of centralized, real-time info about both parking availability and shuttle ETAs.
Market Size & Opportunity:
Authoritative enrollment references used
NCES (Fast Facts / COE): baseline undergraduate enrollment data/projections. National Center for Education Statistics


Recent aggregator (Fall 2024 estimate): EducationData (used to show range). Education Data Initiative


Key assumption (supported by literature above): ~85% of undergraduate students are not living in institution-owned housing (commuter or off-campus residents) — used as an upper-bound estimate for “commuter” population. ERIC+1
Estimates (computed using source totals × 85%) — shown visually below
NCES baseline figure (15.4M undergrads) → ~13.09M commuter students (15,400,000 × 0.85 = 13,090,000). National Center for Education Statistics


NCES projection (16.8M) → ~14.28M commuters. National Center for Education Statistics


EducationData (Fall 2024: 19.28M) → ~16.39M commuters (19,280,000 × 0.85 = 16,388,000). Education Data Initiative


TAM (total addressable market): 13–16.4 million U.S. commuter undergrads (range reflects differing enrollment sources). National Center for Education Statistics+1
SAM (serviceable addressable market): realistic target subset — commuter students at institutions with parking shortages, shuttle systems, and smartphone usage. If we assume ~30–40% of commuters are in campuses/cities where parking + shuttle coordination is acute and the university is open to partnerships → ~3.9M–6.6M students.
SOM (serviceable obtainable market, year 1 pilot): a conservative pilot aiming for 0.5–1% penetration of SAM in year 1 → ~20k–66k active users (depending on SAM assumptions). Use campus pilots (2–5 schools) to validate adoption before scaling.
 
Competitor Analysis:
A. ParkMobile (parking discovery + payments + campus solutions)
What it does: find & pay for parking, reserve spots; offers campus parking integrations / ePermit features for campuses. ParkMobile+1


Strengths: widespread network for on-street and garage payments; campus permit integration where enabled.


Gaps vs. our product idea: focused on payment/reservation and permit management; less emphasis on integrated real-time campus shuttle tracking, predictive ETA for shuttles, or personalized commuter routing across parking + transit. (ParkMobile helps pay but doesn’t by itself unify shuttle + parking availability across a campus.)


B. SpotHero (reservation marketplace; Google Maps integration)
What it does: reserve private parking in cities and lots; recently integrated booking with Google Maps. Good for advance reservations in urban areas. SpotHero+1


Strengths: consumer-friendly reservation experience, deep urban inventory, integrations that simplify discovery.


Gaps: Not tailored to campus permit systems and campus shuttle networks; limited to reservation inventory (not necessarily real-time campus lot occupancy or shuttle ETAs).


C. TransLoc / TransLoc Rider (campus shuttle tracking and microtransit)
What it does: real-time shuttle/bus tracking, schedules, estimated arrivals, bookmarking stops; widely used on campuses for live transit info and on-demand microtransit. TransLoc+1


Strengths: campus transit focus and mature shuttle tracking features.


Gaps: Strong on transit, weaker on live parking availability, permit waitlists, and integrated parking + shuttle routing in a single commuter experience.


Takeaway: existing players each own one slice of the commuter experience: payments/reservations (ParkMobile/SpotHero) or shuttle tracking (TransLoc). A campus-first integrated solution that unifies real-time parking availability, permit/waitlist, and shuttle ETA/predictive routing (plus commuter personalization and equity features) is not currently well served by a single unified app.
Unique Value Proposition (UVP):
“One app for the commuter day.”
 A single, campus-integrated app that combines:
Real-time parking availability (sensor or operator feed + map overlay).


Live shuttle tracking with predictive ETAs (historical + live data).


Permit application, waitlist, & short-term reservations (integrate with existing ePermit systems).


Personalized commuter routing that suggests where to park & whether to take a shuttle, including time-to-class estimates.


Equity features: low-cost reservation options, targeted communication for students with financial need, and data privacy controls.


B2B dashboard for campus admins (analytics: utilization, peak times, equity metrics).


Why it stands out: instead of pushing users to multiple apps (reservation app + transit tracker), it reduces cognitive load and time wasted by combining data layers and offering actionable, predictive recommendations.
