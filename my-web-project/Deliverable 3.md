1) User Group Profile — who, demographics, habits, pain points
Target: Undergraduate commuter students (off-campus, drive or use campus shuttles/buses). Typical persona: Jordan Taylor, 21, drives 15 miles, works part-time, highly comfortable with smartphone apps.
Demographics & habits
Large share of students are commuters: historically -85% of postsecondary students are classified as commuter (do not live in institution housing). (ERIC)


Many commuter students own cars but use mixed transport modes (drive, occasional public transit, campus shuttles) and rely on smartphone apps for navigation, payments, and scheduling. Vendor/app descriptions show campuses increasingly adopt mobile parking and transit apps (ParkMobile, TransLoc). (ParkMobile, TransLoc)


Key pain points
Time loss and stress from searching for parking or waiting uncertainly for shuttles; reported impacts include lateness and missed class. Trellis research finds transportation is a meaningful barrier and correlates with missed classes. (Example stat: some students report missing class “rarely” or “sometimes.”) (Trellis Company)


Difficulty obtaining permits / limited permit supply can negatively affect academic experience (UCLA student survey: 69% felt lack of permit affected academics). (Daily Bruin, Curbed LA)


Low public transit usage among undergraduates in some datasets (single-digit percent) — implying car dependence and demand for parking/shuttle solutions. (blog.kubapay.com)



2) Market Size & Opportunity
Market signals
Large addressable user base: If -85% of students are commuters (national baseline from education data), the app’s target market is a large fraction of U.S. undergraduates — millions of potential users across public and private campuses. (ERIC)


Operational churn & costs: Campuses already contract with parking/transit vendors (ParkMobile, TransLoc, SpotHero/Spot reservations). Many campuses pay for or license solutions and students pay fees or fines — an opening for integrated services that reduce costs (fewer late arrivals, better lot utilization). Vendor marketing materials show active investment by campuses in mobile parking and real-time shuttle tech. (ParkMobile, TransLoc)


Specific opportunity areas
Real-time parking visibility + reservations for commuter students (reduces search time).


Shuttle ETAs, real-time tracking, on-demand microtransit integration (reduces wait uncertainty). (TransLoc)


Equity & retention angle: reducing transportation friction supports attendance and may improve retention metrics that universities track (relevant for admin buy-in). (Trellis Company)



3) 
ParkMobile (campus deployments)
What it does: Mobile payments for metered and lot parking, session alerts, extend sessions, campus integrations (brochure: ParkMobile for campuses). Strength is campus payment convenience and wide adoption (150+ campuses). (ParkMobile)
 Gaps: Focus on payments and session management; limited to payment/permit workflows — not usually integrated with shuttle ETAs, predictive occupancy, or unified multi-modal routing for commuter students.
TransLoc (shuttle & microtransit)
What it does: Real-time shuttle tracking, ETAs, on-demand bookings, campus rider app used by many universities. Strong for live vehicle tracking and rider communications. (TransLoc)
 Gaps: Excellent for transit, but not a parking reservations/payments-first product. Few campuses get a single integrated view combining parking availability + shuttle status in one user experience.
SpotHero (parking reservations)
What it does: Reserve and prepay off-street parking; widely used in cities and near universities for commuter/event parking. Good for guaranteeing a spot near campus (book ahead). (SpotHero)
 Gaps: Works best where private garages/lots exist and are partnerable; less suited to managing university permit inventory, short-term shuttle coordination, or equitable permit allocation for low-income students.
Summary comparison (feature gap): ParkMobile = payments/permits; TransLoc = shuttle tracking; SpotHero = paid reservations. No dominant solution appears to combine real-time campus parking availability + guaranteed/reservable commuter spots + live shuttle ETAs + equity-aware permit/reservation tiers in one student-facing app. (Vendor pages and campus guides show complementary strengths but not a single integrated commuter solution.) (ParkMobile, TransLoc, SpotHero)

4) Unique Value Proposition (UVP)
“One app for arrival certainty.”
 An integrated commuter mobility app that combines:
Real-time campus parking availability (sensors / operator feed) + quick reservation for commuter windows;


Live shuttle/bus tracking and ETA overlay, with smart multimodal routing (walk, drive, shuttle) tailored to class schedule windows;


Predictive availability (machine learning) that forecasts lot occupancy for peak times and recommends earlier departure windows to avoid lateness;


Equity features: subsidized reservations / priority allocation for low-income students, low-cost “commuter vouchers,” and permit waitlist fairness; and


Admin dashboard for transportation offices (utilization analytics, demand forecasting) — making it attractive for institutional contracts and retention KPIs.


Why it stands out: merges features competitors provide separately, targets commuter pain points (search time + shuttle uncertainty), and embeds equity controls to align with ACM ethical principles the project cites.

GenAI tools used
ChatGPT


Web searches via the assistant’s web.run tool to gather primary sources and vendor pages (Trellis research brief, ERIC/education paper, ParkMobile, TransLoc, SpotHero, Daily Bruin/UCLA article).


Representative prompts / queries used
“Find Trellis research brief on transportation as a barrier to higher education and extract statistics on students missing class due to transportation.” (used via web.run search/query) (Trellis Company)


“List ParkMobile campus features and ParkMobile campus brochure.” (ParkMobile)


“TransLoc campus shuttle app features and guide.” (TransLoc, prod.wp.cdn.aws.wfu.edu)


“SpotHero campus parking and reservation features.” (SpotHero)


How outputs were fact-checked / verified
For each claim, I pulled primary or reputable sources: Trellis (research brief), ERIC / academic paper on commuter students, vendor pages (ParkMobile, TransLoc, SpotHero), and a campus news article (Daily Bruin) to corroborate the UCLA permit stat. (Trellis Company, ERIC, ParkMobile, TransLoc, Daily Bruin)


Cross-checked vendor feature claims against multiple pages (product pages + campus integration pages + app store descriptions) to avoid relying on a single marketing statement. (TransLoc, Apple)


Where numbers varied by source or date, I prioritized primary research briefs and education research (Trellis / ERIC) and explicitly noted estimated/approximate framing (e.g., “85%”) instead of presenting small-sample campus polls as universal.
